# Scratch ("Code Lab")

> **Disclaimer:**
> This page is not yet finished, expect many notes written by Jae to remind himself of finishing this.

This is a modified version of Scratch (and Scratch Jr.), made using presumably the [open source version of Scratch](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-blocks).
It is heavily reliant on the actual Cozmo app to run, but the interface itself seems to function perfectly fine without it.
(The horizontal blocks index is more functional than the vertical one's.)
> **Info:**
> The source code seems to be ALSO hosted on Anki's Github, but it is not accessible, probably privated. We published it to our GitHub [here](https://github.com/RazuProject/CozmoScratch).
Anki ALSO didn't seem to work on this alone, according to their readme they contracted [CodeRefactory](https://www.coderefactory.com/).
Makes sense since they probably didn't wanna waste development time on web dev.
