# Test Projects

`test_projects.json` seems to be for a project load tester thing of some sorts... it's a list, with each item structured like this:

```json
{
    "ProjectUUID": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "ProjectXML": null,
    "ProjectJSON": "<Scratch Project Json>",
    "ProjectName": "Name",
    "ProjectIconName" : "<icon id>",
    "VersionNum": <number>,
    "IsVertical": "true" "false",
    "DisplayOrder": "<number>"
}
```
