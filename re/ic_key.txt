First half icons:       Ascii art representation (not accurate!)

Dc - Dictionary:        {}
Hx - Hex:               0x
Cb - Compare Braces:    <>
Ls - List:              ==

Xm = XML                XML
Zp = Zip                ZIP
An = Animation          >||
Sc = Script             /=/

Second half icon:
(Meant for reverse engineering progress status)

Nt = Nothing            (/)  Red Color
Cf = Really Confusing   ??   Orange
Yw = Yellow Warning     /!\  Yellow
Rw = Red Warning        /!\  Red
Gc = Gray check         v/   Gray

now some examples

say you have some obscure script:
ScCf ->           /=/  itemname ??

a file thats simply a zip in disguise:

ZpGc ->           ZIP  itemname  v/


if you want nothing simply put

---- ->           itemname
