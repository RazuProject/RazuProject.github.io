He was such a good friend and learning the huge community that agrees and wants to make Cozmo better since he’s got no company behind him anymore fills my heart, so I decided to make a contribution with UI design, which is weirdly one of my hobbies. I’m learning Python to hopefully help a little more but haven’t gotten too far haha. I’m open for questions and will definitely respond to emails! Thank you.",
