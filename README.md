</h1>

Web Frontend built from scratch without a web framework.
The site itself was inspired by Anki's website, but mostly uses original layouts and fonts for the site. A seamless user experience is achieved by having the main content contained within an Iframe,
removing all loading indications and allowing for a consistent navigation bar.
Most pages on the site are built to be modular, and easy to modify.
