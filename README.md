</h1>

Framework-less Web Frontend. The site itself was inspired by Anki's website,
but it copies almost none of the CSS. Design itself implemented from scratch.

Seamless experience works by having the main content contained in an Iframe,
removing all loading indications and allowing for a consistent nav bar.
Most pages are built to be modular, and easy to modify.
